# gui-report-dialog-java
Java Swing dialog for selecting and executing configurable reports from a backend system.

# Composite Report Builder (Demo)

This is a demo of a GUI module for managing composite reports in a logistics platform.

The dialog allows users to:
- Create and edit report definitions
- Add or remove sub-elements (filters, queries, etc.)
- Manage metadata such as name and note
- Load existing definitions and show results

This code is extracted from a real-world application and demonstrates GUI logic written in Java (Swing) with custom table models and service integration.

Note: This is a partial showcase focused on frontend logic only. Back-end services are not included.
